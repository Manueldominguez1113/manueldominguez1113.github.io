    I am an Air-force veteran, spending years as an Air Traffic Controller, now an aspiring full stack developer interested in creating for you, be it new and exciting websites, artistic and unique approaches, to working on functionality and fluid
    user interaction.

    I began in 2008 going through my first half of high school in Design and Technology Academy, but followed my family's footsteps to serve my nation for 8 years after graduation. Returning in late 2021-2022
    to begin again in Code-up LLC.</div>
